# Projects clearinghouse/greenhouse #

Besides providing resources for organising data sprints and teaching data literacy through a societally situated approach, the website of Data Inquiries will also serve as a space for generative encounters between students, data scientists and civil society groups.
 
More specifically the website is meant to function as a clearinghouse where societal actors can describe the objectives of their data projects and define the kind of contribution they seek and where students and experts can find occasion for practicing data science and alpha-users for their techniques. 
 
The Data Inquiries website will not host datasets or precise specifications for computational challenges (which would negate the very essence of this approach), instead it will contain a **catalogue of inquiry ideas** meant to serve as starting points for conversation between different actors and potentially for collaboration. As such, it will be a clearinghouse but also a greenhouse where new projects and collaborations are nurtured.
 
A **typical inquiry idea** will be proposed by a civil society organisation (e.g. an NGO, a citizen association, a newsroom, an interest group, a research consortium, a public institution, an informal initiative...) and will be composed of:
* The definition of the long-term objectives presented not as a list of computational tasks, but as a description of the societal context addressed by the proposal, the overall motivation for intervening  in it, and the general intervention strategy.
* Using the example of the "Fake News Field Guide"...*
 
* A short description of the data available (if any), of the sources where they can be found or of ideas to generate them.
* Using the example of the "Fake News Field Guide"...*
 
* A general description of the kinds of contributions that would be most welcome. Here again, the idea is not to list specific tasks or needs, but to start a dialogue, by presenting open-ended ideas, stumbling blocks or opportunities to be exploited.
* Using the example of the "Fake News Field Guide"...*
 
* The names of the reference-persons for the inquiry at the civil society organisation and details on how to contact them and start a conversation about possible collaborations.
