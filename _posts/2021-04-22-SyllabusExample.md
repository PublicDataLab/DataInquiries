This course explores the consequences of the digital traceability of collective phenomena with a **critical and empirical approach**. Considering a variety of computational methods, it offers first-hand experience of digital quantification, examining its potential, but also its shortcomings and biases. Students will learn techniques of data collection, corpus cleaning, exploratory analysis, network analysis, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and information visualization. Working in groups, they will apply these techniques to actual societal situations. Through this experience, they will be led to consider reflexively the insights of the transdisciplinary field of critical data studies.

## Course structure
The course is composed of three main parts:
1. Critical theories of quantification, digital and online media.
2. Digital, computational and qualitative-quantitative methods.
3. Case study group work.

The version of the course presented in this page grants equal space to the three parts, but each can be expanded according to the curriculum in which the course is integrated.

* **The theoretical part** can be developed considering the impacts of media and digital infrastructures to encourage critical reflection on subjects related to 
**  *Gender Studies* and *Political and Cultural Geography*, discussing the social and cultural consequences of digital media, particularly with regard to constructions of gender, class, ethnicity, etc.
**  *Political Economy*, *Security Studies* and *Political Sciences*, by extending the reflections on the effects of quantification in the government of modern societies at the national and international levels.

* **The methodological part** can be developed for curricula in *Digital Humanities*, *Journalism*, *Media Studies* and *Social Research and Intervention*, by introducing more advanced numerical and computational methods and discussing the advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as the possible integration with them.

* **The practical part** can be developed and focussed on case studies around subjects directly relevant for programs in *Public Management*, *Sustainable Development*, *Science and Technology Studies*, *Innovation Management*, etc.

## Pedagogical approach
While data literacy is increasingly considered as an essential skill in a variety of curricula, its teaching is often unfit to prepare students for their future occupations. Trained on predefined exercises and artificial datasets, students are rarely exposed to the messiness of real data practice. They assimilate techniques of digital analysis and visualization, but fail to learn the subtler craft of thinking about and with data. Focussing too much on data crunching and not enough on the conditions of the production of data and on the consequences of their use, this type of training discourages reflexivity and encourages a naively technical approach to data literacy. Students are rarely brought to reflect on the work necessary to distill datasets from social and natural phenomena and even less on the (side)effects of managing those phenomena through their data-doubles.
To promote a richer and more realistic approach to "data literacy", this course draws on the literature from disciplines such as science and technology studies, media studies, political sciences, security studies etc. Data Inquiries, however, does not deliver these insights through a conceptual instruction, but rather through group-work on real projects developed by civil organizations working with data.
