This course explores the consequences of the digital traceability of collective phenomena with a **critical and empirical approach**. Considering a variety of computational methods, it offers first-hand experience of digital quantification, examining its potential, but also its shortcomings and biases. Students will learn techniques of data collection, corpus cleaning, exploratory analysis, network analysis, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and information visualization. Working in groups, they will apply these techniques to actual societal situations. Through this experience, they will be led to consider reflexively the insights of the transdisciplinary field of critical data studies.

## Course structure
The course is composed of three main parts:
1. Critical theories of quantification, digital and online media.
2. Digital, computational and qualitative-quantitative methods.
3. Case study group work.

The version of the course presented in this page grants equal space to the three parts, but each can be expanded according to the curriculum in which the course is integrated.

* **The theoretical part** can be developed considering the impacts of media and digital infrastructures to encourage critical reflection on subjects related to 
**  *Gender Studies* and *Political and Cultural Geography*, discussing the social and cultural consequences of digital media, particularly with regard to constructions of gender, class, ethnicity, etc.
**  *Political Economy*, *Security Studies* and *Political Sciences*, by extending the reflections on the effects of quantification in the government of modern societies at the national and international levels.

* **The methodological part** can be developed for curricula in *Digital Humanities*, *Journalism*, *Media Studies* and *Social Research and Intervention*, by introducing more advanced numerical and computational methods and discussing the advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as the possible integration with them.

* **The practical part** can be developed and focussed on case studies around subjects directly relevant for programs in *Public Management*, *Sustainable Development*, *Science and Technology Studies*, *Innovation Management*, etc.

## Pedagogical approach
While data literacy is increasingly considered as an essential skill in a variety of curricula, its teaching is often unfit to prepare students for their future occupations. Trained on predefined exercises and artificial datasets, students are rarely exposed to the messiness of real data practice. They assimilate techniques of digital analysis and visualization, but fail to learn the subtler craft of thinking about and with data. Focussing too much on data crunching and not enough on the conditions of the production of data and on the consequences of their use, this type of training discourages reflexivity and encourages a naively technical approach to data literacy. Students are rarely brought to reflect on the work necessary to distill datasets from social and natural phenomena and even less on the (side)effects of managing those phenomena through their data-doubles.
To promote a richer and more realistic approach to "data literacy", this course draws on the literature from disciplines such as science and technology studies, media studies, political sciences, security studies etc. Data Inquiries, however, does not deliver these insights through a conceptual instruction, but rather through group-work on real projects developed by civil organizations working with data.  

## Course objectives and learning outcomes
1. Explore a variety of different digital techniques for collecting, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing data. Be able to compare the strengths and weaknesses of the different conceptual, mathematical and technical tools and to choose the ones that suit best the resources and objectives of one's project.
2. Develop the ability to adapt to the constant evolution of computational technologies. Know how to update one's repertoire of technical and conceptual tools and learn how to find new software, scripts, libraries and how to adapt them to one's needs.
3. Become familiar with all the stages of a data inquiry and learn to manage such a project from start to finish, by effectively linking different tools and dealing with the accumulation of transformations and possible distortions that this implies.
4. Develop a critical reflection on the impacts of the increasing quantification of social life promoted by digital technologies. Learn to appreciate its potential for scientific research, public debate and the management of communities and businesses, but also to recognize its possible biases and its economic and political consequences.
5. Know how to work in groups and in collaboration with other actors. Know how to organize a data project as a collective and participatory effort. Work in cooperation with other students, but also with stakeholders inside and outside the academy.

## Class programme

### Part I - Theories of quantification, digital and online media

####Class 1 - Introduction
* **In preparation for the class**, read this syllabus carefully and prepare at least one question about the course.
* **During the class**, we will present the objectives of the course, its pedagogical approach and its expectations in terms of effort during and between the classes. We will also introduce the potentials, but also the risks of the social use of data and computational methods.

####Class 2 - “An Engine not a Camera”, the consequences of categorization and quantification
* **In preparation for the class**, read and prepare for the discussion of one of the following texts:
* Desrosières A (1990) How to Make Things Which Hold Together : Social Science, Statistics and the State in *Discourses On Society*. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers.
* Bowker GC and Star SL (1999). “The Case of Race Classification and Reclassification under Apartheid” in *Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences*. Cambridge Mass: MIT Press.
* Porter TM (1995). “How social numbers are made valid” in *Trust in Numbers*. The Pursuit of Objectivity in Science and Public Life. Princeton: University Press.
* **During the class**, through a discussion of the above texts, we will discuss the effects of categorization and quantification by showing that, far from being neutral and descriptive, these operations transform and perforate their objects.
